# Object-Oriented Programming Course

## Overview
This repository contains laboratory and project code created during the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at AGH University of Krakow, Faculty of Computer Science (Winter semester 2024/2025).  
During the lab sessions, I developed an application from scratch that simulates the lives of animals on a map.  
As part of the project, together with [Dawid Żak](https://github.com/depebul), we implemented an app called **Darwin World**.  
You can find more about the project in the [projekt branch](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/projekt).

## Branches
Each lab session was implemented on a separate branch. Below is a list of all branches and their topics:
- **[lab0](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab0)** – Git: Distributed Version Control System
- **[lab1](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab1)** – Java Control Statements
- **[lab2](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab2)** – Object-Oriented Model
- **[lab3](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab3)** – Interactions Between Objects
- **[lab4](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab4)** – Interfaces and Maps
- **[lab4-bonus](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab4-bonus)** – Parameterization and Generic Types
- **[lab5](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab5)** – Inheritance
- **[lab5-bonus](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab5-bonus)** – Improved Randomization Algorithm
- **[lab6](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab6)** – Code Refactoring
- **[lab7](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab7)** – Multithreading
- **[lab8](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/lab8)** – Graphical Interface
- **[proj-lab1](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/proj-lab1)** – Resource Management
- **[proj-lab2](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/proj-lab2)** – Kotlin

You can find the final project on the [projekt branch](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/tree/projekt).  
During **lab0**, we completed [Git exercises](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/) — [here is my report (in Polish)](https://github.com/Blizek/Object-Oriented-Programming-Course/blob/main/Raport%20zadania%20git%20B%C5%82a%C5%BCej%20Naziemiec.pdf) covering 21 out of 23 exercises.

## Grade
Throughout the course, I earned **99.4/100 points**, including lab work, project, and additional bonus sessions.

Each lab was submitted as a pull request. You can find them in the **Pull requests > Closed** section — each one corresponds to an individual lab.  
Each lab was worth up to 4 points. The final project was worth 32 points. Bonus labs:
- **Marchewka (Carrot)**: +10% bonus for Java labs
- **Pietruszka (Parsley)**: +10% bonus for the project

## Course Exercises
You can find the course exercises (in Polish) [here](https://github.com/Soamid/obiektowe-lab/tree/master).  
Note: tasks may vary slightly each year depending on the lecturer.

## Technical Requirements
To run the code, you need:
- **Java 21** installed
